# Mealman1551's Repository

Welcome to the **ADC-compile-from-scratch** repository! This repository includes all the necessary files for manually compiling a setup or MSI without needing to use the setup from the main branch.

## Overview

This repository contains the **Nukita** files required to compile an EXE package from scratch. It is designed for users who want to build the software manually without relying on precompiled setups.

**Please Note:**  
- This repository does not include the EXE files or precompiled setups. It is solely intended for compiling the software from scratch using the following resources:
    - C
    - H
    - O
    - Python files (`.py`, `.pyw`, `.pyd`)
    - DBlite/SQLite
    - BIN
    - CONST
    - TK and TCL files

## Prerequisites

Before you start compiling, you need to have the following installed:

- **Python 3** (with the Nukita library)
- **C** (for compiling C-based files)
- **Python Tkinter** (for GUI-related tasks)
- **DBlite/SQLite** (for database operations)
- **JavaScript** (to modify certain files if needed)

## Setup

1. Install **Python 3** from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the **Nukita library** for Python (refer to the [Nukita documentation](https://nukita.readthedocs.io/) for installation steps).
3. Ensure that **C**, **Tkinter**, **DBlite/SQLite**, and **JavaScript** are installed and properly configured on your system.

## Compiling from Scratch

To compile the software manually, you will need to use the Python source code file: 

- **`ADC Archiver 1.2.0.py`** (Full source code)

Follow the instructions in the repository to properly compile the EXE package from the scratch using the provided files and resources.
