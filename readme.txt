Hii, this is Mealman1551

This repository includes all files for manually moving and compiling an setup or msi without needing to use the setup from the main branch.

This repository will have Nukita files for compiling an exe package from scratch.

The repository doesn't have the exe's or setups, this is only for compiling for scratch with:

c, h, o, pyw, pyd, py, dblite, const, bin, tk and tcl

To compile install Python3 with the Nukita library

The Python source-code file (full source-code) is called "ADC Archiver 1.2.0.py"




Please note you need to have C, Python, Python tKinter, DBlite/SQLite, Javascript installed to modify files
