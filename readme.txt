ADC Compile from Scratch

Welcome to the ADC-compile-from-scratch repository! This repository includes all the necessary files for manually compiling a setup or MSI without needing to use the setup from the main branch.

Overview

This repository contains the Nukita files required to compile an EXE package from scratch. It is designed for users who want to build the software manually without relying on precompiled setups and/or precompiled executables.

Please Note:

This repository does not include the EXE files or precompiled setups. It is solely intended for compiling the software from scratch using the following resources:

C

H

O

Python files (.py, .pyw, .pyd)

DBlite/SQLite

BIN

CONST

TK and TCL files

Prerequisites

Before you start compiling, you need to have the following installed:

Python 3 (with the Nukita library)

C (for compiling C-based files)

Python Tkinter (for GUI-related tasks)

DBlite/SQLite (for database operations)

JavaScript (to modify certain files if needed)

Setup

Install Python 3 from the official Python website (Python 3.12.x recommended).

Install the Nukita library for Python (refer to the Nukita documentation for installation steps).

Ensure that C, Tkinter, DBlite/SQLite, and JavaScript are installed and properly configured on your system.

Compiling from Scratch

To compile the software manually, you will need to use the Python source code file:

ADC Archiver 1.2.0.py (Full source code)

For detailed compilation instructions, please refer to the "Compiling Instructions" document online at the ADC-compile-from-scratch repo.

For any further questions or issues, you can create an issue on the ADC-compile-from-scratch repo online!
